WHAT IS ALLEGRO?
---------------------------------

Allegro is a web application designed to make learning sheet music more fun through interactive games!

As opposed to the traditional method of learning to read music in a boring music book with your instructor or tutorial videos,  
Allegro teaches you sheet music through playing games. 

With a fun scoring system and constructive feedback, we are sure you wil learn music fast and most importantly, have fun while you do it.

After a quick tutorial and some practice, you'll be reading notes like a pro!

ADDITIONAL NOTES
---------------------------------

<-----!!WARNING!!----->
THE PITCH GAME CAN GET VERY LOUD ON HIGHER OCTAVES
As a rule of thumb, the higher the octave, the lower you want your volume and vice versa.

<-----!!WARNING!!----->
GOOGLE LOGIN DOES NOT WORK ON LOCALHOST
To run Allegro locally, you must run from menu.html instead of index.html

<-----ALERT----->
The score page will not show scores properly on LOCALHOST. 
This is due to how the scores are saved in Firebase.
To get scores to display properly, please use the online version of Allegro.

<-----ALERT----->
Currently, the score page will display all of the users who have registered a score.
This is for demonstration purposes to show how the score table dynamically expands depending on how many users are in the database.
This can easily be limited to prevent the score tables from getting too large.
